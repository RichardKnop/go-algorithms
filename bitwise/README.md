# Bit Operations

## Left Rorate Bits

Let n is stored using 8 bits. Left rotation of n = 11100101 by 3 makes n = 00101111 (Left shifted by 3 and first 3 bits are put back in last). Whatâ€™s the expression you would use to do left rotation on 8 bits integer n by k times?

## Turn Off Nth Bit

Given a 8-bit integer x, how do you turn off the i-th (0-based) bit?
